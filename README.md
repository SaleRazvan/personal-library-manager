This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Node > 20

Yarn > 1.22

# To run the application:

yarn
yarn start
```

### Start react app

```
cd books_library
yarn
yarn dev
```

#### Notes

This was my first interaction with swr and formik, so some of the patterns might not be best-practice

The styling and validation was minimal and rudimentary in essence, it can naturally be improved
